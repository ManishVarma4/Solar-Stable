# Solar Stable

A powerful Android application designed to calculate the efficiency of solar panels and provide maintenance alerts when efficiency drops below expected thresholds. This tool helps users optimize energy output and ensures the longevity of their solar panels.

## Features
- **Efficiency Calculation**: Calculates real-time efficiency of solar panels based on input data.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Automatically notifies users when efficiency falls below the expected value.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless user interaction.
- **History Maintained**: Stores previously calculated results for future reference.

## How It Works
1.Log in.
2.Select Your Solar Provider.
3. Input the solar panel specifications (e.g., panel size, Current, etc.).
4. The app calculates efficiency and displays the results.
5. If efficiency drops below the predefined threshold, the app generates a maintenance alert.
6. The Calculated Efficiency gets stored.

## Technologies Used
- **Android Studio**: Primary IDE for development.
- **Java**: Programming language for app logic and functionality.
- **GitHub**: Version control and code hosting.
